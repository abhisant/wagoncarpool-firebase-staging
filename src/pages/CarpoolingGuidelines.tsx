                            Violating our Terms of Use or community guidelines may result in restricted access or a temporary or permanent ban from Wagon Carpool. This may include certain actions carpoolers may take outside of the app, if we determine that those actions threaten the safety of the Wagon Carpool community, or cause harm to Wagon Carpoolâ€™s brand, reputation or business.
