<p><span >3. THE SERVICES</span></p>
<p><em><span >About the Services</span></em></p>
<p><span >Wagon Carpool provides, by way of the Platform, a marketplace for offering, posting, listing, requesting, searching for, discovering, inquiring about, marketing, scheduling, and arranging for Rides by and among Drivers and Riders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >The Platform is a set of online and mobile tools that match Riders with Drivers to facilitate the servicing of rides by Drivers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >Riders may use the Platform to request, order, search for, inquire about, schedule, and arrange for Rides offered and serviced by Drivers. Drivers may use the platform to post, list, offer, market, schedule, and arrange for Rides that they propose to provide to Riders. Riders and Drivers are matched, or otherwise agree to meet at pre-arranged locations, using our proprietary Platform tools and functionality based on a number of factors, which, among other things, may include the geographical location of pickup and drop off points, length of the proposed Ride requested or offered, time frame in which the applicable Ride is requested or offered or when it is scheduled to take place, and type of Ride experience offered or requested.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >As a user, you authorize the Company to allow other users to send you match requests, in each case based on factors such as your location, the estimated time to pick up, your destination, user preferences, and platform efficiency. In each case, you also authorize the Company to cancel any scheduled Ride and in which case you will have to find another match for your ride using the platform, based on the same or other considerations and factors. You, as a user, always have an option to accept or reject any such received requests. Driver Services and Rides that are offered and provided by Drivers through the Platform are not offered by us for services and are not part of the Wagon Carpool Services or the Platform. Riders may use the Platform to discover, arrange for and agree to accept any Driver Services in their sole discretion, and we are not involved in or part of any decision by a Rider to accept a Ride or other Driver Services using the Platform, nor is the Company responsible in any respect for a Rider&rsquo;s decision to accept and agree to any Driver Services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >The Company does not provide transportation services, and the Company is not a transportation carrier, common carrier, or public carrier. It is up to the Driver to decide whether or not to offer a Ride to a Rider contacted through the Platform and up to the rider to accept a ride offered by the driver. We cannot ensure that a Driver or Rider will complete any arranged Ride. Since Drivers provide Rides, we have no control over the quality or safety of any Ride that occurs as a result of facilitation and scheduling through the Platform.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span >We care about the safety of our users. The platform provides all users an option to verify their employment by providing their work email id and the platform can only confirm that a user has access to the work email address provided. The platform has no way to confirm that the user on the platform is indeed the owner of the provide work email address and there can be no assurance that, and we make no representations or warranties whatsoever that, our verification process helps to keep our Platform safe, there can be no assurance that, and we make no representations or warranties whatsoever that, our Onboarding process will keep you safe if you participate in any Rides or procure any Driver Services through our Platform.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span >AS A RIDER OR A DRIVER, YOU AGREE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY RIDE THAT YOU ORDER, PARTICIPATE IN OR RECEIVE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND YOU ASSUME ALL OF THE RISK FOR ANY SUCH RIDE THAT YOU REQUEST, PROCURE OR PROVIDE, AND THE COMPANY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, INJURY OR HARM THAT MAY ARISE AS A RESULT OF ANY RIDE THAT YOU REQUEST, ORDER, &nbsp;PROCURE, ACCEPT, PARTICIPATE OR PROVIDE IN OR RECEIVE THROUGH USE OF THE PLATFORM OR OTHERWISE.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span >WE DO NOT PROVIDE DRIVERS WITH INSURANCE COVERAGE. EACH DRIVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR CARRYING AN ACTIVE INSURANCE POLICY WITH APPLICABLE RIDESHARE RIDERS, ADDENDUMS, AND COVERAGE AS REQUIRED BY THE LOCALITIES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong><span >DRIVERS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THEY ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR CONFIRMING THAT THEY HAVE ALL REQUIRED INSURANCE COVERAGE TO USE THE VEHICLE(S) WITH THE PLATFORM, AND THAT WE HAVE NO LIABILITY FOR ANY LACK OF COVERAGE OR LOSS OF COVERAGE DUE TO USE OF THE PLATFORM.</span></strong></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span >WHILE WE MAY NOT ACTIVELY BE CONFIRMING THESE ADDITIONAL COVERAGES, IT IS STILL THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH DRIVER TO CARRY THESE APPLICABLE RIDESHARE RIDERS, ADDENDUMS OR ADDITIONAL COVERAGE TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN THE CITIES AND STATES IN WHICH THEY OPERATE.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span >AS A RIDER, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTAND THAT ANY RIDES OR DRIVER SERVICES THAT YOU REQUEST, ORDER, PARTICIPATE IN OR RECEIVE COME WITH THE RISK THAT THE DRIVER PROVIDING THE RIDE WILL NOT HAVE ADEQUATE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO COVER ANY LOSSES, HARM, INJURY OR DAMAGES THAT ARISE IN RESPECT OF ANY RIDE OR DRIVER SERVICES. IT IS UPTO THE RIDER TO VERIFY BEFORE THE RIDE THAT THE DRIVER HAS THE DRIVING LICENSE AND INSURANCE REQUIRED TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE AND THE DRIVER HAS THE AUTHORIZATION TO OPERATE THE VEHICLE</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span >The Platform includes functionality that facilitates the ability for Riders and/or Drivers to arrange for and schedule Rides. Some of these tools and functions utilize and rely on third-party applications to process data and payments and for other functionality (collectively, &ldquo;Third Party Applications&rdquo;). The Platform provides a conduit for users to access or use, indirectly through the Platform, such Third Party Applications. Although we reserve the right to use Third Party Applications as part of the Platform, our use of any such Third Party Applications does not imply approval or endorsement thereof by the Company. By agreeing to this Agreement, you give us express permission to use such Third Party Applications as part of the Platform and the Wagon Carpool Services, including for the processing and managing of payments and collection and disbursement of funds through the Platform and the transmission and disclosure of any personal information or data that may be necessary in connection therewith.</span></p>
