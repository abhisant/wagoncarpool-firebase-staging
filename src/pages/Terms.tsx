                        <ul><li>Wagon Carpool provides, by way of the Platform, a marketplace for offering, posting, listing, requesting, searching for, discovering, inquiring about, marketing, scheduling, and arranging for Rides by and among Drivers and Riders.

                            <li>
                                The Platform is a set of online and mobile tools that match Riders with Drivers to facilitate the servicing of rides by Drivers.

                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Riders may use the Platform to request, order, search for, inquire about, schedule, and arrange for Rides offered and serviced by Drivers. Drivers may use the platform to post, list, offer, market, schedule, and arrange for Rides that they propose to provide to Riders. Riders and Drivers are matched, or otherwise agree to meet at pre-arranged locations, using our proprietary Platform tools and functionality based on a number of factors, which, among other things, may include the geographical location of pickup and drop off points, length of the proposed Ride requested or offered, time frame in which the applicable Ride is requested or offered or when it is scheduled to take place, and type of Ride experience offered or requested.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                As a user, you authorize the Company to allow other users to send you match requests, in each case based on factors such as your location, the estimated time to pick up, your destination, user preferences, and platform efficiency. In each case, you also authorize the Company to cancel any scheduled Ride and in which case you will have to find another match for your ride using the platform, based on the same or other considerations and factors. You, as a user, always have an option to accept or reject any such received requests. Driver Services and Rides that are offered and provided by Drivers through the Platform are not offered by us for services and are not part of the Wagon Carpool Services or the Platform. Riders may use the Platform to discover, arrange for and agree to accept any Driver Services in their sole discretion, and we are not involved in or part of any decision by a Rider to accept a Ride or other Driver Services using the Platform, nor is the Company responsible in any respect for a Rider’s decision to accept and agree to any Driver Services.

                                The Company does not provide transportation services, and the Company is not a transportation carrier, common carrier, or public carrier. It is up to the Driver to decide whether or not to offer a Ride to a Rider contacted through the Platform and up to the rider to accept a ride offered nby the driver. We cannot ensure that a Driver or Rider will complete any arranged Ride. Since Drivers provide Rides, we have no control over the quality or safety of any Ride that occurs as a result of facilitation and scheduling through the Platform.

Riders may receive coupons, discount codes, or other incentives that Riders can apply toward payment of certain Fees upon completion of a Ride. Such coupons, discount codes or other incentives are only valid for use on the Platform, and are not transferable or redeemable for cash except as required by law. Such coupons, discount codes, or other incentives generally cannot be combined, and if the cost of your Ride exceeds the applicable credit or discount unit value we will charge your payment method on file for the outstanding cost of the Ride or other Driver Services. If you split payment for a Ride with another Rider, your coupon, discount code, or incentive will only apply to your portion of the Fees. Additional restrictions on coupons, discount codes, and incentives may apply as communicated to you in a relevant promotion or by clicking on the relevant promotion on the Platform. If you are a Rider, in order to use the Platform to order and purchase Rides or Driver Services, you must provide account information for at least one current, valid payment method.

You authorize the Company to charge you the full amount owed in respect of any Fees due and payable by you. Upon addition of a new payment method by you or each Ride request, order or purchase, the Company may seek authorization of your selected payment method to verify the payment method, ensure the Ride cost will be covered, and protect against unauthorized behavior. The authorization is not a charge, however, it may reduce your available credit by the authorization amount until your bank’s next processing cycle. Should the amount of our authorization exceed the total funds on deposit in your account, you may be subject to overdraft charges by the bank issuing your debit or prepaid card. We cannot be held responsible for these charges and are unable to assist you in recovering them from your issuing bank. If a Rider fails to pay amounts of Fees due and payable, whether by canceling his or her credit or debit card, initiating an improper chargeback, or any other means, the Company may suspend or close the Rider’s account and revoke the Rider’s access to the Platform. Without limiting other available remedies, the Rider must pay the Company upon demand for amounts owed under this Agreement, plus interest on the outstanding amount at the lesser of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month or the maximum interest allowed by applicable law, plus attorneys’ fees and other costs of collection to the extent permitted by applicable law.

The Company may share your applicable account information to authorized third party collection agencies in the case of non-payment. In cases of fraud, abuse, or violation of this Agreement by any Driver, the Company reserves the right to revoke or prevent the payment of any amounts due to such Driver unless prohibited by applicable law, and to seek reimbursement of any amounts paid to such Driver.
